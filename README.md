# AR_Poster
This is an Augmented Reality poster prototype being built for the NASA SUITS project based on ARWT for Unity. 

It allows the user to click a link to a github pages site which will allow them to scan an image tracking target on a physical poster at conference or demonstration 
event with their mobile device. The poster can then be overlayed with videos, animations and mini games. This repository contains a simple demo of a basic crash 
bandicoot game running based on a mobile tracking target. To use:
- 1.) Click link to WebGL Unity application

- 2.) Allow tracking for image recognition and positional tracking
- 3.) Frame this image tracking target with your mobile devices camera
